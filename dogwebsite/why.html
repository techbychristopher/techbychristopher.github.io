        <h2>Why I refer Dogs over Cats</h2>
        <p>Dogs can be very helpful little friend in your life. Something that dogs can do really well is protect your house from other people. They also can become a service animal for those in need for one. The most important thing about them is that they bring love and care to peoples houses.</p>
